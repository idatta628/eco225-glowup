# Background
During the Winter 2025 semester at the University of Toronto, I took a project-based course: Big Data Tools for Economists (ECO225). The goal of this course was to apply the data analysis tools and methods we learned in class to a particular dataset, culminating in a research paper and notebook. We covered the different aspects of doing a data analysis: literature review and developing a research question; gathering and joining data (including through web/API scraping); data cleaning; exploratory data analysis (EDA); data visualizations (including geospatial ones); some machine learning models; and the interpretation of our results. We were also introduced to various Python libraries to help us with the project, as well as learning how to use GitHub and SQL.

Long story short: my project was a massive flop. My chosen research question was vague; the data was incredibly patchy; the EDA and visualizations were messy and didn't add much information; and the interpretations were half-written. I did not end up with a project that I'd be proud to present to anyone.

Over the summer, I decided to revisit this failed project - and revitalize it. This time, I'd develop a research question that would lead to meaningful results; I'd construct visualizations that are both elegent and insightful; and I'd have a bigger, more coherent story to tell about the data I worked with.

Hence this project was born. It is still in the works right now (note to self: edit this part later), so come back later!
